## 0x00. Pascal's Triangle
## Overview
This project involves implementing Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The goal is to generate and return the rows of Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Understand and explain Pascal's Triangle.
2. Generate Pascal's Triangle using Python.
3. Use lists and list comprehensions.
4. Define and call functions.
5. Implement loops and conditional statements.

## Concepts to Revise
1. Lists and List Comprehensions: Create, access, modify, iterate over lists, and use list comprehensions.
2. Functions: Define and call functions, pass parameters, return values.
3. Loops: Use for and while loops, nested loops for generating rows.
4. Conditional Statements: Apply if, elif, and else conditions.
5. Recursion (Optional): Understand base cases and recursive cases.
6. Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition for calculating elements.
7. Indexing and Slicing: Access elements and slices of lists.
8. Memory Management: Understand how lists are stored and copied.
9. Error and Exception Handling (Optional): Use try-except blocks.
10. Efficiency and Optimization: Consider time and space complexity.
