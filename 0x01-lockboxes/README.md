## 0x01. Lockboxes

## Overview
This project involves solving a puzzle where you need to determine if all boxes can be opened given a set of locked boxes and keys. Each box is numbered sequentially and may contain keys to other boxes. The goal is to check whether it is possible to open all the boxes starting from the initially unlocked box.

## Algorithm
The solution to the problem is implemented in Python, using a combination of list manipulation and dictionary-based tracking of box statuses. The key components of the solution include:

- Tracking Opened Boxes: Keep track of which boxes are open and the keys they contain.
- Finding the Next Box: Identify the next box that has been opened and explore the keys inside it.
- Checking Completion: Determine if all boxes have been opened by checking the status of all boxes.

## Conceptual Knowledge
To effectively tackle this problem, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

- Lists and List Manipulation: Understanding how to work with lists in Python.
- Graph Theory Basics: Knowledge of graph traversal algorithms can be useful.
- Algorithmic Complexity: Awareness of time and space complexity to write efficient algorithms.
- Recursion: Some solutions may involve recursive techniques.
- Queue and Stack: Useful for implementing traversal algorithms like BFS or DFS.
- Set Operations: Efficiently track visited boxes and available keys.
