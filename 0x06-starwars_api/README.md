## Star Wars Characters

## Overview
Welcome to the "0. Star Wars Characters" project! This project involves writing a Node.js script that fetches and displays information about Star Wars characters from a specific movie using the Star Wars API. You will need to use the request module to interact with the API and handle asynchronous operations to retrieve and display the character names in the correct order.
