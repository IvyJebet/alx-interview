## x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Overview
The "0x04. UTF-8 Validation" project is designed to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. This involves applying bitwise operations and understanding the UTF-8 encoding scheme using Python.

## Concepts to Master
1. Bitwise Operations in Python:
Learn how to manipulate bits using AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and shifts (<<, >>).

2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:
Understand the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are represented using one or more bytes.

3. Review encoding patterns that signify valid UTF-8 characters.

## Resources:
- UTF-8 Wikipedia
- Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle
- The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets

## Data Representation:
Work with data at the byte level and handle the least significant bits (LSB) of integers.

## List Manipulation in Python:
Iterate through lists, access list elements, and use list comprehensions effectively.

##Boolean Logic:
Apply logical operations to make decisions within the program.

## Additional Resource
Mock Technical Interview: Practice and refine your understanding with mock interviews.
