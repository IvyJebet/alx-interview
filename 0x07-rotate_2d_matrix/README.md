## 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This project will test your understanding of matrix manipulation and your ability to perform operations in-place, which is crucial for optimizing space complexity.

## Key Concepts
To complete this project, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

## 1. Matrix Representation in Python
- Representing 2D matrices using lists of lists.
- Accessing and modifying matrix elements.

## 2. In-place Operations
- Performing operations without creating a copy of the data structure.
- Minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix directly.

## 3. Matrix Transposition
- Swapping rows and columns.
- Transposing the matrix as part of the rotation process.

## 4. Reversing Rows in a Matrix
- Reversing the order of rows to achieve the final rotated matrix.

## 5. Nested Loops
- Iterating through 2D data structures.
- Modifying elements using nested loops.
